		<h2>CONTROLS</h2>
		<p>Much like other role playing games, this game works around menus. <br>
		Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around the menus and press Z to confirm. <br>
		In town you can purchase items with <b>Gold</b> (upper right) and talk to people. <br>
		When you're ready to enter the dungeon, select <b>Depart</b> from the town menu. <br>
		In dungeon, use the left and right arrow keys to turn, forward and backward to move. <br>
		Press Z to open your menu and use purchased items. <br>
		Sometimes when you walk you'll encounter monsters, in which menus open with options. <br>
		Select <b>Attack</b> to deal damage, and <b>Magic</b> to deal greater damage, however this costs <b>MP</b> <br>
		which is represented by the blue bar. If you don't have enough you wont be able to use it. <br>
		Once all enemies are defeated, you earn <b>Gold</b> which you can use to purchase more items. <br>
		If your characters' <b>HP</b> bar reaches 0 (green bar), they die. If both characters die you get <br>
		a game over.
		<br>
		<br>
		Good luck exploring!
